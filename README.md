## FAQ

<details><summary>»<b>I've used the <i>Applet Installer</i> to install/update the <i>Dark Flat Skin Installer</i> but there's <i>no menu item</i> with this name.</b>«</summary><br><p>
Confirm that your device has (unlimited) <i>access to the internet</i>. The jivelite Applet Installer (<i>Settings > Advanced > Applet Installer</i>) gets the list of available applets from your (local) LMS server. Your device will then (try to) download the applet <b><i>directly</i></b> from the source (URL).
</p></details><br>

<details><summary>»<b>The Applet Installer doesn't show me the latest applet version.</b>«</summary><br><p>

- Go to <i>Settings -> Advanced -> Applet Installer</i> and confirm that <i>Recommended Applets Only</i> is <b>dis</b>abled.<br>

- Confirm that your server and device <b>both</b> have <b>internet access</b>.<br>

- If it's a <b>caching</b> problem, try this:<br>

    - reload the <i>LMS Settings -> Manage Plugins</i> page so the server has the latest list of available applets<br>

    - if you enter the <i>Settings -> Advanced -> Applet Installer</i> menu and it doesn't show the latest update, exit the menu and wait a couple of minutes before calling it again.
</p></details><br>

<details><summary>»<b>I can't open the <i>Screen > NowPlaying > NowPlaying Views</i> menu.</b>«</summary><br><p>
This is a jivelite quirk that's not tied to any skin in particular. Just <b>enter the NowPlaying screen</b> using the top right note icon. Then go back and try again. That usually solves it. If not, make sure that you have selected a player and that this player is connected.
</p></details><br>

<details><summary>»<b>How do I switch to next NowPlaying screen from the <i>lyrics</i> NowPlaying screen?</b>«</summary><br><p>
You need to click/touch the <b>track title in the title bar</b>. The lyrics (text) cannot be used for that because you can scroll up or down in the song lyrics using click-hold/touch-hold.
</p></details><br>

<details><summary>»<b>I have changed some skin settings. When I go to the Now Playing screen immediately afterwards, the Now Playing screen does not display the changes, the screen layout is wrong or the buttons don't work as they should.</b>«</summary><br><p>
Sometimes you need to <i>switch to another Now Playing view</i> before the changes take effect.</p></details><br>

<details><summary>»<b>Clicking/touching the stars on the NowPlaying screen does not change the rating. Why?</b>«<br>»<b>How Do I <b>un</b>rate a track on the NowPlaying screen?</b>«<br>»<b>How do I change the track rating by half a star on the NowPlaying screen?</b>«</summary><br><p>
To rate a track directly on the Now Playing screen, the <b>track must be part of the LMS library</b> (applies to local and remote/online tracks). And you need the <a href="https://github.com/AF-1/#-ratings-light"><b>Ratings Light</b></a> plugin. Make sure the Now Playing screen setting <i>Rate tracks directly on screen</i> is enabled.<br><br>
To <b><i>un</i>rate</b> a track click/touch the space to the left or right of the rating stars. Since the space to the <i>left</i> of the rating stars is quite small on Now Playing views <i>with artwork</i>, it's probably better to click/touch the space to the right (about 40px wide).<br><br>
Alternatively or additionally, you can replace the <i>Shuffle</i> and <i>Repeat</i> buttons on Now Playing views that display track ratings with <b>rating buttons</b> that will increase or decrease the track rating by half a star. This setting is not enabled by default and can be change here: <i>Settings > Screen > Dark Flat Skin</i>.
</p></details><br>

<details><summary>»<b>I've selected a different VU meter design but it still displays the old one.</b>«</summary><br><p>
Please note: on <b>piCorePlayer</b>, the VU meter you select for the <i>Dark Flat Skin</i> is also used by the <i>Dark Flat <b>Grid</b> Skin</i>. You can't set a different VU meter for the <i>Grid</i> skin.<br><br>

For guaranteed success:<br>

- <b>SqueezePlay</b>: restart SqueezePlay.<br>On <i>Windows</i> (and possibly <i>Linux</i>) selecting a different VU meter requires <i>admin privileges</i>. Please read the corresponding FAQ article below<br>

- <b>piCorePlayer</b>: use the <i>Quit</i> button to restart jivelite.<br>

- <b>SB Touch</b>: reboot your device.<br><br>

Works <i>sometimes</i>:<br>

- Go to <b>Settings > Screen > NowPlaying > NowPlaying views</b>.<br>

- Deselect the analog VU meter view.

- Exit the menu.

- Then reenter the menu and select the analog VU meter view again.
</p></details><br>

<details><summary>»<b><i>SQUEEZEPLAY</i> on <i>WINDOWS</i> and <i>LINUX</i></b>«</summary><br><p>
<b>WINDOWS</b>:<br>
<b>Installing</b> and <b>uninstalling</b> the skin and <b>changing the VU meter design</b> require <b>admin privileges</b> on Windows, i.e. you need to `run SqueezePlay as admin` to install, uninstall or change the VU meter design.<br><br>
The installer has to rename files in and copy files to the <i>NowPlaying</i> and <i>Clock</i> applet folders in the protected <i>jive applet folder</i>. And on Windows, creating symbolic links (to change the VU meter design) seems to require admin privileges too.<br><br>
<b>LINUX</b>:<br>
It probably depends on <i>where</i> you've installed SqueezePlay. The installer requires write permissions (755) to rename files in and copy files to the <i>NowPlaying</i> and <i>Clock</i> applet folders in the <i>jive applet folder</i>.<br>
If you install the skin using <i>sudo</i>, it will install the userpath skin files in the <i>root</i> user's home folder. And nobody wants to run SqueezePlay as root all the time.<br>
So either the installer can write to the <i>jive applet folder</i> or you install the applet (files) manually.
</p></details><br>

<details><summary>»<b><i>SB Touch</i>: <i>after a reboot</i> the device seems to fall back to the <i>WQVGAsmallSkin</i> skin. Selecting the <i>Dark Flat Skin doesn't stick</i>.</b>«</summary><br><p>
The SB Touch knows 3 different skins settings: <b>Touch</b> Skin, <b>Remote</b> Skin, and just <b>”Skin”</b>. The GUI menus will let you change the <b>Touch</b> and the <b>Remote</b> skin type but not the type <b>“Skin“</b> which resets to <i>WQVGAsmallSkin</i> after every reboot.<br>
However, it's easy to fix:<br>

- go to **Settings > Screen > Select skin > Touch Skin**<br>

- select <i>WQVGAsmallSkin</i><br>

- and then select <i>Dark Flat Skin</i> again.<br><br>

It's a trade-off: <i>Dark Flat Skin</i> is a stand-alone/separate applet that's easy to install/uninstall. But that causes quirks like this one. It only happens after a <i>reboot</i>. So decide for yourself if you think it's worth it.
</p></details><br>

<details><summary>»<b><i>piCorePlayer & SB Touch</i>: My device is stuck in a <b>jivelite reboot loop</b>.</b>«</summary><br><p>
If the installation / update didn't complete successfully or if you manually deleted skin files or folders, jivelite will still try to load the (missing or damaged) Dark Flat Skin. Instead of doing a factory reset, you can try to log in to your device and repair this:<br>

- enable remote (SSH) access to your [<b>Touch</b>](https://github.com/AF-1/sobras/wiki/Command-line-access-to-SB-Radio-and-SB-Touch) (Settings > Advanced) or <b>piCorePlayer</b> (pCP Web UI > Main > Security) and log in to your device.<br>

- change to the the user <i>settings</i> folder:<br>

    - on the <b>Touch</b>: `cd /etc/squeezeplay/userpath/settings`<br>

    - on <b>piCorePlayer</b>: `cd /home/tc/.jivelite/userpath/settings`<br>

- open the settings file called <i>SelectSkin.lua</i> with your default editor (vi or nano) (on piCorePlayer you need to use sudo).

- change the selected skin in that file to the default skin:<br>    - Touch: `skin="WQVGAsmallSkin"`<br>    - piCorePlayer:  `skin="JogglerSkin"`<br>

- save your changes to that file<br>

- <b><i>piCorePlayer only</i></b>: do a backup using `pcp bu`<br>

- reboot your device.

<details><summary>»<b>If I can't use the DFS uninstaller (Settings > Advanced), how do I <i>manually clean up the files</i> added or modified by the DFS installer on my device?</b>«</summary><br><p>
<b><i>SqueezePlay</i></b>: locate the <i>user applets</i> folder with the DarkFlatSkin folders, the path ends with `/userpath/applets/`. Delete all folders whose names start with `DarkFlatSkin`. Then delete and reinstall the SqueezePlay app.<br><br>

<b>The steps below only apply to <i>piCorePlayer</i> and <i>Touch</i>:</b>

- enable remote (SSH) access to your [<b>Touch</b>](https://github.com/AF-1/sobras/wiki/Command-line-access-to-SB-Radio-and-SB-Touch) (Settings > Advanced) or <b>piCorePlayer</b> (pCP Web UI > Main > Security) and log in to your device.<br>

- you need these applet folder path(s):<br>
	- <b>Touch</b>: all applets are installed to the same folder: `/usr/share/jive/applets/`<br>

	- <b>piCorePlayer</b>: you only need the <i>user</i> applets folder: `/home/tc/.jivelite/userpath/applets/`<br>

- delete all folders starting with `DarkFlatSkin`<br>

- <b><i>piCorePlayer</i> only</b>: delete the <i>NowPlaying</i> and <i>Clock</i> folders in the <i>user applets</i> folder as well.

- <b><i>Touch</i> only</b>: have a look at the <i>NowPlaying</i> and the <i>Clock</i> folders.<br>

	- in the <b>NowPlaying</b> applet folder:<br>if you have a file called `NowPlayingApplet.lua_ORG` in this folder, delete the file `NowPlayingApplet.lua` and then rename `NowPlayingApplet.lua_ORG` to `NowPlayingApplet.lua`.<br>Do the same with `NowPlayingMeta.lua_ORG` and `strings.txt_ORG`.<br>

	- in the <b>Clock</b> applet folder:<br>if you have `ClockApplet.lua_ORG` in the this folder, delete `ClockApplet.lua` and then rename `ClockApplet.lua_ORG` to `ClockApplet.lua`.

- <b><i>piCorePlayer only</i></b>: if there's a file called `/opt/bootlocal.sh.orig` in the `/opt` folder, delete the file called `bootlocal.sh` in that folder and rename `/opt/bootlocal.sh.orig` to `/opt/bootlocal.sh`.<br>You can also delete this file: `/home/tc/darkflatskin_bootscript.sh`.<br>

- <b><i>piCorePlayer only</i></b>: do a backup using `pcp bu`<br>

- reboot your device.
</p></details><br>

<details><summary>»<b><i>piCorePlayer</i>: I've enabled the analog VU meter and spectrum visualizer NowPlaying views but when I toggle through the NowPlaying views, these two are missing.</b>«</summary><br><p>
The VU meter and spectrum visualizer are only displayed if the device running jivelite is also a local player (e.g. if you have SqueezeLite running on your piCorePlayer device).

[^1]: Based on *JogglerSkin* (piCorePlayer, SqueezePlay) and *WQVGAsmallSkin* (SB Touch).
[^2]: I don't own a SB Touch device. So I can't troubleshoot issues of the SB Touch version beyond UI issues. For known issues on SB Touch devices, please see the FAQ.
[^3]: Genre is only displayed on piCorePayer and SqueezePlay. Not enough screen space on SB Touch.
[^4]: The screenshots might not correspond to the current UI in every detail.
